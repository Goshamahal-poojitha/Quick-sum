**ABSTRACT : **
Quick summarization is a critical task in the field of natural language processing (NLP) aimed at condensing large documents into shorter, more digestible forms while retaining key information. The goal is to provide efficient solutions for users dealing with information overload, enabling quicker access to essential content while maintaining the integrity of the original text. Ultimately, the system seeks to improve productivity in fields such as research, legal analysis, and content creation. This project develops an AI-powered document summarization system that extracts key insights not only from text but also from images, tables, and charts. Using OCR(optical character recognition) and computer vision, the system identifies text in images and interprets structured data from tables, while NLP models generate concise summaries. It supports various document formats like PDFs and scanned reports, making complex data more accessible. This solution enhances productivity in domains like finance, healthcare, and research by providing multi-modal, structured, and intelligent summaries.
**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to develop an automated document summarization tool that efficiently condenses the content of large project documents into concise summaries. This tool will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information, identify important sections, and generate meaningful summaries. By providing users with quick access to the essential details of a document, the tool aims to save time, enhance decision-making, and improve productivity in environments where handling extensive project documentation is common.
**Scope**
The scope of this project includes designing and implementing an automated system that can summarize a variety of project-related documents, such as reports, proposals, technical papers, and meeting notes. The tool will focus on extracting critical information such as objectives, methodologies, conclusions, and key findings, while maintaining the context and integrity of the original text. The system will be evaluated based on the accuracy, relevance, and clarity of its summaries. While the project will be primarily focused on English-language documents, future extensions may include support for multiple languages. Additionally, the tool will be scalable and adaptable to different document formats (PDF, Word, etc.).

**Conclusion**
The QuickSum project presents an AI-powered document summarization system designed to enhance information accessibility and productivity across various fields. By integrating NLP, OCR, and computer vision, the system efficiently condenses large documents while preserving essential insights. Its ability to process diverse content formats, including text, images, tables, and charts, makes it a versatile tool for users managing information overload. Ultimately, QuickSum aims to streamline research, legal analysis, and content creation by providing concise, accurate summaries. â€‹
**Future Scope**
The future scope of the Document Summarization mini-project includes enhancing summarization techniques by integrating abstractive summarization and fine-tuning for domain-specific applications like legal or medical fields. It can offer customizable summaries (length, style, focus) and combine extractive + abstractive methods for better accuracy. Additionally, the project could support multimedia summarization (images, tables, audio), provide real-time processing, and integrate with platforms like Google Drive. Features like user feedback, interactive editing, and scalability for large document batches will further enhance its usability and performance.
